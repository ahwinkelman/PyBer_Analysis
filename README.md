# PyBer_Analysis

The written analysis has the following:

##Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)

The purpose of this analysis was to break down the ride sharing data by city type to display raw total numbers and break down variables for each city type.  The goal was to present how the ride experiences differ by city type and to highlight the benefits for each marker.



##Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

This analysis shows the break down of totals and averages by city type.  While Rural cities had significantly lower rides, drivers, and total fares; the averages for fare per ride and fare per driver were substantially larger than suburban and urban cities.  This is caused by larger demand with fewer drivers in the area and potentially longer rides causing the customer to have to pay for a higher premium.  While the average fare per ride and per driver were lower, Urban cities did produce the ~62% of total fares.


##Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
1.Since ~62% of my total fares come from the cities, I would prioritize the majority of my time on Urban cities if I needed to prioritize my time.
2. I  would perform a time per ride to deep dive a correlation between total ride
3.I would dive into what is causing the higher average fares in rural cities to see if there is a potential miss in the marker because the customers deem it is too expensive to use their service.
